- Private internal networking
- Persistent volumes for data durability

## Services Deployed
- Nextcloud (file storage)
- Uptime Kuma (service monitoring)
- Heimdall (service dashboard)
- Supporting databases and utilities

## Security Considerations
- Least-privilege container permissions
- Regular system and container updates
- No unnecessary public port exposure
- Firewall and access control enforcement

## Outcomes
- Improved understanding of Linux services and networking
- Real-world troubleshooting of availability and configuration issues
- Experience documenting infrastructure for reproducibility
